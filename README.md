# This is an RNA aligner that produces almost the same output as STAR. You can use our aligner in a way very similar to STAR.

We have only implemented bulk RNA-seq alignment at this moment. We will implement an scRNA-seq aligner next. 

ToDo list now.

1. OutputManager
2. Two-pass
3. Pair-ends
4. Chimeric
